Python Examples
===============

+ In the following folders are various examples of python coding from basic to intermediate.
+ In order to use most of these python examples the numpy module is required.
+ For python users 3.3+ I have included the numpy windows installer file.
+ These python scripts are made to be compatible with python 3.3.2 and above.
+ I can not guarantee that they will work with versions below 3.3.2.
+ The descriptions of what each script does is contained within the title and inside the code comments.
